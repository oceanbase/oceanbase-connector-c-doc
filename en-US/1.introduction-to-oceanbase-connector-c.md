Overview

OceanBase Connector/C is an OceanBase client development component based on C/C++. OceanBase Connector/C supports the C API library.

OceanBase Connector/C allows C/C++ programs to access OceanBase distributed database clusters from the underlying layer to perform operations such as database connection, data access, error handling, and prepared statement processing.

OceanBase Connector/C, also known as `LibOBClient`, is used by applications as an independent server process to communicate with OBServers based on network connections. A client references the C API header file during compilation and can connect to the C API library file.
**Note**



The `so` file generated by `LibOBClient` is `libobclnt.so`, which is equivalent to `libmysqlclient.so`. After you install OceanBase Database, you can use the command-line tool OceanBase Client (OBClient), which is equivalent to a MySQL command-line tool.

The following table describes the compatibility between OceanBase Connector/C and OBServer.


| **OceanBase** Connector/C **version** | **Compatible OBServer version** |
