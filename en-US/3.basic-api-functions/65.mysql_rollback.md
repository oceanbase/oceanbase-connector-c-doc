mysql_rollback()
=====================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_rollback
You can call the `mysql_rollback()` function to roll back the current transaction.

Syntax
---------------------------

```unknow
my_bool
mysql_rollback(MYSQL *mysql)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

0 is returned for an execution success, and a non-zero value is returned for errors.

Errors
---------------------------

None.

Notes
--------------------------

The action of this function is determined by the value of the `completion_type` system variable. If the value of `completion_type` is `RELEASE` or 2, after the transaction is terminated and the connection with the client is closed, the server will release the connection.

You can call the `mysql_close()` function on the client program to close the connection from the client side.
