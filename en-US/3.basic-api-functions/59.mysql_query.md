mysql_query()
==================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_query
You can call the `mysql_query()` function to execute the SQL statement to which the null-terminated string `stmt_str` points.

Syntax
---------------------------

```c
int
mysql_query(MYSQL *mysql,
            const char *stmt_str)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

0 is returned for an execution success, and a non-zero value is returned if an error occurred.

Errors
---------------------------

* `CR_COMMANDS_OUT_OF_SYNC`: Commands were executed in an improper order.



* `CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR`: The connection to the OBServer was disconnected.



* `CR_SERVER_LOST`: The connection to the server was lost during the query.



* `CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR`: An unknown error occurred.






Notes
--------------------------

Generally, a string must consist of a single SQL statement without a terminating semicolon (;) or `\g`. If multi-statement execution is enabled, a string can contain multiple statements separated with semicolons (;).

You cannot use the `mysql_query()` function to execute statements that contain binary data. Instead, you must use the `mysql_real_query()` function. Binary data may contain the `\0` character. The `mysql_query()` function parses this character as the end of a statement string. To execute a statement that contains binary data, use the `mysql_real_query()` function.

Call the `mysql_field_count()` function to check whether the statement returns a result set.
