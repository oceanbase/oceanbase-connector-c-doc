mysql_thread_init()
========================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/null
`mysql_thread_init()` initializes a thread handle.

Syntax
---------------------------

```unknow
my_bool
mysql_thread_init(void)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

If the function is executed, zero is returned. If an error occurs, a non-zero value is returned.

Notes
--------------------------

You must call this function as early as possible in every created thread to initialize variables that are specific to threads. However, you do not need to explicitly call `mysql_thread_init()` after you call the following functions: `mysql_init()`, `mysql_library_init()`, `mysql_server_init()`, and `mysql_connect()`. This is because `mysql_thread_init()` is implicitly called by the preceding functions.
