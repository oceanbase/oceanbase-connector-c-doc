mysql_shutdown()
=====================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/int-mysql_shutdown
You can call the `mysql_shutdown()` function to shut down a database server.

Syntax
---------------------------

```c
int
mysql_shutdown(MYSQL *mysql,
               enum mysql_enum_shutdown_level shutdown_level)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

0 is returned for an execution success, and a non-zero value is returned if an error occurred.

Errors
---------------------------

* `CR_COMMANDS_OUT_OF_SYNC`: Commands were executed in an improper order.



* `CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR`: The connection to the OBServer was disconnected.



* `CR_SERVER_LOST`: The connection to the server was lost during the query.



* `CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR`: An unknown error occurred.






Notes
--------------------------

The logged-on user must have the `SHUTDOWN` privilege.

A MySQL server can be shut down only by calling this function. `shutdown_level` must be equal to `SHUTDOWN_DEFAULT`.
