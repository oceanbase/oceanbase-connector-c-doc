mysql_thread_id()
======================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/null
`mysql_thread_id()` returns the thread ID of the current connection.

Syntax
---------------------------

```unknow
unsigned long
mysql_thread_id(MYSQL *mysql)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

The thread ID of the current connection.

Error messages
-----------------------------------

None.

Notes
--------------------------

The value of thread ID can be used as the argument of `mysql_kill()` to terminate the thread.

If the connection is lost and then re-established by calling `mysql_ping()`, the thread ID changes. Therefore, we recommend that you do not store the obtained thread ID for later use.

If the thread ID is greater than 32 bits, this function cannot work properly. To avoid errors for `mysql_thread_id()`, you can execute the `SELECT CONNECTION_ID()` query, retrieve the results, and get the connection ID.
