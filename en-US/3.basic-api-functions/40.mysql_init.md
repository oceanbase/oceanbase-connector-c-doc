mysql_init()
=================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_init
You can call the `mysql_init()` function to allocate or initialize a `MYSQL` object suitable for `mysql_real_connect()`.

Syntax
---------------------------

```unknow
MYSQL *
mysql_init(MYSQL *mysql)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

An initialized `MYSQL*` handler is returned, or `NULL` is returned if there was insufficient memory to allocate a new object.

Errors
---------------------------

In case of insufficient memory, `NULL` is returned.

Notes
--------------------------

If `mysql` is a `NULL` pointer, the function allocates, initializes, and returns a new object. Otherwise, the object is initialized and the address of the object is returned. If `mysql_init()` allocates a new object, it is released when `mysql_close()` is called to close the connection.

In a non-multithreaded environment, `mysql_init()` calls `mysql_library_init()` automatically as necessary. However, `mysql_library_init()` is not thread-safe in a multithreaded environment. Therefore, `mysql_init()` is also not thread-safe. Before you call `mysql_init()`, call `mysql_library_init()` before generating any threads, or use a mutex to protect the `mysql_library_init()` call. This operation must be performed prior to any other client library call.
