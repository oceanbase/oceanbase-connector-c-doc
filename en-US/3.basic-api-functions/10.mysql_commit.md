mysql_commit()
===================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_commit
You can call the `mysql_commit()` function to commit the current transaction.

Syntax
---------------------------

```unknow
my_bool
mysql_commit(MYSQL *mysql)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

0 is returned for a commit success, and a non-zero value is returned if an error occurred.

Errors
---------------------------

None.

Notes
--------------------------

The behavior of this function depends on the value of the `completion_type` system variable. If the value of `completion_type` is `RELEASE` or 2, after the transaction is terminated and the connection with the client is closed, the server will release the connection. You can call the `mysql_close()` function on the client to close the connection from the client side.
