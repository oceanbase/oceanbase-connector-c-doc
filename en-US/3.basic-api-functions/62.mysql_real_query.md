mysql_real_query()
=======================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_real_query
You can call the `mysql_real_query()` function to execute an SQL statement that `stmt_str` points to.

Syntax
---------------------------

```c
int
mysql_real_query(MYSQL *mysql,
                 const char *stmt_str,
                 unsigned long length)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

0 is returned for an execution success, and a non-zero value is returned for errors.

Errors
---------------------------

`CR_COMMANDS_OUT_OF_SYNC`: Commands were executed in an improper order.

`CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR`: The connection to the OBServer was disconnected.

`CR_SERVER_LOST`: The connection to the server was lost during the query.

`CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR`: An unknown error occurred.

Notes
--------------------------

Generally, a string must consist of a single SQL statement without a terminating semicolon (;) or `\g`. If multi-statement execution is enabled, a string can contain multiple statements separated with semicolons (;).

You cannot use the `mysql_query()` function to execute statements that contain binary data. Instead, you must use the `mysql_real_query()` function. (Binary data may contain the `\0` character, which the `mysql_query()` function may parse as the end of a statement string.)

In addition, `mysql_real_query()` does not call `strlen()` on the statement string and therefore is faster than `mysql_query()`.

Call the `mysql_field_count()` function to check whether the statement returns a result set.
