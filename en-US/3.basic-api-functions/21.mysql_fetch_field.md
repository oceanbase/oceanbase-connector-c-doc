mysql_fetch_field()
========================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_fetch_field
You can call the `mysql_fetch_field()` function to return the type of the next table field.

Syntax
---------------------------

```c
MYSQL_FIELD *
mysql_fetch_field(MYSQL_RES *result)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

The `MYSQL_FIELD` structure of the current column is returned, and `NULL` is returned if no more columns are left.

Errors
---------------------------

None.

Notes
--------------------------

`mysql_fetch_field()` returns the definition of one column in a result set as a `MYSQL_FIELD` structure.

You can call this function repeatedly to retrieve information about all columns in the result set. `mysql_fetch_field()` returns `NULL` when no more fields are left.

`mysql_fetch_field()` is reset to return information about the first field each time a new `SELECT` query is executed. The field returned by `mysql_fetch_field()` is also affected by calls to `mysql_field_seek()`.

If you have called `mysql_real_query()` or `mysql_query()` to perform a `SELECT` operation on a table without calling `mysql_store_result()`, OceanBase returns the default `BLOB` length (8 KB) when you call `mysql_fetch_field()` to query the length of a `BLOB` field.

Once the result set is retrieved, `field->max_length` contains the length of the largest value in this column in the specific query.
