mysql_hex_string()
=======================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_hex_string
You can call the `mysql_hex_string()` function to create a valid SQL string.

Syntax
---------------------------

```unknow
unsigned long
mysql_hex_string(char *to,
                 const char *from,
                 unsigned long length)
```



The string in the `from` argument is encoded in hexadecimal format, with each character encoded as two hexadecimal digits.

The length of the string that `from` points to must be `length` bytes. Therefore, at least `length*2+1` bytes must be allocated to the buffer.

The result is placed in the `to` argument, followed by a terminating null character. When `mysql_hex_string()` returns, the content of `to` is a null-terminated string. The return value is the length of the encoded string, excluding the terminating null character.

The return value can be placed into an SQL statement by using the `X'value'` or `0xvalue` format. However, the return value does not include `X'...'` or `0x`.

Return values
----------------------------------

The length of the encoded string is returned, excluding the terminating null character.

Errors
---------------------------

None.
