mysql_list_processes()
===========================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_list_processes
You can call the `mysql_list_processes()` function to return a result set that describes the current server threads.

Syntax
---------------------------

```c
MYSQL_RES *
mysql_list_processes(MYSQL *mysql)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

A `MYSQL_RES` result set is returned for an execution success, and `NULL` is returned if an error occurred.

Errors
---------------------------

* `CR_COMMANDS_OUT_OF_SYNC`: Commands were executed in an improper order.



* `CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR`: The connection to the OBServer was disconnected.



* `CR_SERVER_LOST`: The connection to the server was lost during the query.



* `CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR`: An unknown error occurred.






Notes
--------------------------

The result set returned by this function is the same kind of information as that reported by `mysqladmin processlist` or a `SHOW PROCESSLIST` query.

After the call is completed, you must free the result set with `mysql_free_result()`.

`mysql_list_processes()` is deprecated. Use `mysql_real_query()` instead.
