mysql_stmt_fetch_column()
==============================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_stmt_fetch_column
You can call the `mysql_stmt_fetch_column()` function to fetch one column from the current result set row.

Syntax
---------------------------

```unknow
int
mysql_stmt_fetch_column(MYSQL_STMT *stmt,
                        MYSQL_BIND *bind,
                        unsigned int column,
                        unsigned long offset)
```



Arguments

* `bind` provides the buffer where data should be placed. It should be set in the same way as `mysql_stmt_bind_result()`.



* `column` indicates the column to fetch. The first column is numbered 0.



* `offset` is the offset for retrieving data within the data value. It can be used to fetch the data value in pieces. The beginning offset of the value is 0.






Return values
----------------------------------

0 is returned for an execution success, and a non-zero value is returned if an error occurred.

Errors
---------------------------

`CR_INVALID_PARAMETER_NO`: The column number was invalid.

`CR_NO_DATA`: The end of the result set has already been reached.
