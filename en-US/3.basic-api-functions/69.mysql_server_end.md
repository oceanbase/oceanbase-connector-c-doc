mysql_server_end()
=======================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_server_end
You can call the `mysql_server_end()` function to finalize the C API library.

Syntax
---------------------------

```unknow
void
mysql_server_end(void)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

None.

Notes
--------------------------

To avoid memory leaks after the application finishes using the library, for example, after the connection to the server is closed, you must explicitly call `mysql_server_end()` or `mysql_library_end()` so that memory management is performed to clear and release the resources occupied by the library. We recommend that you call the `mysql_library_end()` function.
