mysql_stmt_sqlstate()
==========================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/null
`mysql_stmt_sqlstate()` returns the `SQLSTATE` value for the most recently called prepared statement API function.

Syntax
---------------------------

```c
const char *
mysql_stmt_sqlstate(MYSQL_STMT *stmt)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

A string that contains the `SQLSTATE` error code and ends with a null character.

Notes
--------------------------

For a statement specified by `stmt`, `mysql_stmt_sqlstate()` returns a string that ends with a null character and contains the `SQLSTATE` error code of the most recently called prepared statement API function. The execution of the API function can succeed or fail.

The error code consists of five characters. "00000" indicates no errors. These codes are specified by ANSI SQL and ODBC.

Not all errors are mapped to the `SQLSTATE` codes. The code "HY000" (general errors) is used for unmapped errors.

If the API function of a failed statement is `mysql_stmt_close()`, do not call `mysql_stmt_sqlstate()` to obtain the error information because `mysql_stmt_close()` invalidates the statement handle. Instead, we recommend that you call `mysql_sqlstate()`.
