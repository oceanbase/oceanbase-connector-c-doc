mysql_eof()
================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_eof
You can call the `mysql_eof()` function to determine whether the last row of a result set has been read.

Syntax
---------------------------

```unknow
my_bool
mysql_eof(MYSQL_RES *result)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

None.

Errors
---------------------------

None.

Notes
--------------------------

This function is deprecated. `mysql_errno()` or `mysql_error()` may be used instead.

If you acquire a result set from a successful call to `mysql_store_result()`, the client receives the entire set in one operation. In this case, a `NULL` return value from `mysql_fetch_row()` means the end of the result set has been reached and it is unnecessary to call `mysql_eof()`. When used with `mysql_store_result()`, `mysql_eof()` always returns `TRUE`.

If you use `mysql_use_result()` to initiate a result set retrieval, the rows of the set are obtained from the server one by one as you call `mysql_fetch_row()` repeatedly. Because an error may occur on the connection during this process, a `NULL` return value from `mysql_fetch_row()` does not necessarily mean the end of the result set was reached. In this case, you can use `mysql_eof()` to determine what happened. `mysql_eof()` returns a non-zero value if the end of the result set was reached, and 0 if an error occurred.
