mysql_list_tables()
========================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_list_tables
You can call the `mysql_list_tables()` function to return a result set consisting of table names that match the simple regular expression specified by the `wild` argument.

Syntax
---------------------------

```c
MYSQL_RES *
mysql_list_tables(MYSQL *mysql,
                  const char *wild)
```



`wild` may contain the `%` or `_` wildcard characters, or may be a `NULL` pointer to match all tables.

Return values
----------------------------------

A `MYSQL_RES` result set is returned for an execution success, and `NULL` is returned if an error occurred.

Errors
---------------------------

* `CR_COMMANDS_OUT_OF_SYNC`: Commands were executed in an improper order.



* `CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR`: The connection to the OBServer was disconnected.



* `CR_SERVER_LOST`: The connection to the server was lost during the query.



* `CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR`: An unknown error occurred.






Notes
--------------------------

Calling `mysql_list_tables()` is similar to executing the query `SHOW TABLES [LIKE wild]`.

After the call is completed, you must free the result set with `mysql_free_result()`.
