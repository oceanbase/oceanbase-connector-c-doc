mysql_kill()
=================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_kill
You can call the `mysql_kill()` function to request the server to kill the thread specified by `pid`.

Syntax
---------------------------

```c
int
mysql_kill(MYSQL *mysql,
           unsigned long pid)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

0 is returned for an operation success, and a non-zero value is returned for errors.

Errors
---------------------------

* `CR_COMMANDS_OUT_OF_SYNC`: Commands were executed in an improper order.



* `CR_INVALID_CONN_HANDLE`: The `pid` was greater than 32 bits.



* `CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR`: The connection to the OBServer was disconnected.



* `CR_SERVER_LOST`: The connection to the server was lost during the query.



* `CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR`: An unknown error occurred.



* `ER_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE`: The internal thread ID counter of the server has reached a value greater than 32 bits. In this case, the server rejects all `mysql_kill()` calls.






Notes
--------------------------

`mysql_kill()` cannot handle values greater than 32 bits. However, to avoid killing the wrong thread, it returns an error in the following cases:

* Given an ID greater than 32 bits, `mysql_kill()` returns a `CR_INVALID_CONN_HANDLE` error.



* After the internal thread ID counter of the server reaches a value greater than 32 bits, the server returns an `ER_DATA_OUT_OF_RANGE` error for `mysql_kill()` calls, and `mysql_kill()` fails.
