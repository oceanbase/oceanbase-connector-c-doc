mysql_stmt_reset()
=======================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/null
`mysql_stmt_reset()` resets statements on the server, the data sent by the `mysql_stmt_send_long_data()` function, unbuffered result sets, and current errors.

Syntax
---------------------------

```c
my_bool
mysql_stmt_reset(MYSQL_STMT *stmt)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

If the function is executed, zero is returned. If an error occurs, a non-zero value is returned.

Error messages
-----------------------------------

* `CR_COMMANDS_OUT_OF_SYNC`: Commands are executed in an incorrect order.



* `CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR`: The connection to the OBServer was interrupted.



* `CR_SERVER_LOST`: The connection to the server was lost during the query.



* `CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR`: An unknown error occurred.






Notes
--------------------------

`mysql_stmt_reset()` resets prepared statements on the client and server but does not clear bindings or stored result sets. The stored result sets are cleared when you execute or close the prepared statement.

To re-prepare the statement in another query, use `mysql_stmt_prepare()`.
