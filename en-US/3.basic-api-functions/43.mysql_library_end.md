mysql_library_end()
========================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_library_end
You can call the `mysql_library_end()` function to finalize the C API library.

Syntax
---------------------------

```c
void
mysql_library_end(void)
```



Notes
--------------------------

Call this function when you finish using the library, for example, after disconnecting from the server. To avoid memory leaks, you must call `mysql_library_end()` explicitly so that memory management is performed to clear and release the resources occupied by the library.
