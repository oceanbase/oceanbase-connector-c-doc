mysql_server_init()
========================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_server_init
You can call the `mysql_server_init()` function to initialize the OceanBase client library.

Syntax
---------------------------

```c
int
mysql_server_init(int argc,
                  char **argv,
                  char **groups)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

0 is returned for an execution success, and a non-zero value is returned for errors.

Notes
--------------------------

To avoid memory leaks after the application finishes using the library, for example, after the connection to the server is closed, you must explicitly call `mysql_server_end()` or `mysql_library_end()` so that memory management is performed to clear and release the resources occupied by the library. We recommend that you call the `mysql_library_end()` function.
