mysql_select_db()
======================================
#docslug#/connector-c/connector-c/V2.0.0/mysql_select_db
You can call the `mysql_select_db()` function to set the database specified by `db` as the default (current) database on the connection specified by `mysql`.

Syntax
---------------------------

```c
int
mysql_select_db(MYSQL *mysql,
                const char *db)
```



Return values
----------------------------------

0 is returned for an execution success, and a non-zero value is returned for errors.

Errors
---------------------------

* `CR_COMMANDS_OUT_OF_SYNC`: Commands were executed in an improper order.



* `CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR`: The connection to the OBServer was disconnected.



* `CR_SERVER_LOST`: The connection to the server was lost during the query.



* `CR_UNKNOWN_ERROR`: An unknown error occurred.






Notes
--------------------------

The logged-on user must have the privilege to use the database specified by the `db` argument or an object in the database. Otherwise, `mysql_select_db()` fails.
